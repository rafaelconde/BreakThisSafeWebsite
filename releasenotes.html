    <h1>Break this Safe</h1>
    <p>Hello dear beta testers, this is a preliminary version of my first Apple Watch game.<br>Have fun!</p>

    <h2>What's new:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Redesigned Screens.</li>
      <li>New stats, press *More Stats* to see the full list.</li>
      <li>Now every game has a timer ‚Äì you have to complete it under 30s ‚Äì good luck!</li>
      <li>New icons and animations, no more placeholder emoji üí©</li>
      <li>Force Touch in the Main Menu to Reset Stats and send me some Feedback!</li>
      <li>New option to quickly start a new game, so you don't have to go back to the Menu every time.</li>
      <li>New alert to let you know that the game should be played with the Watch on *Silent Mode* (only visible for new users)</li>
      <li>This build is probably going to be the last one before the game ships, it would mean a lot to me if you let me know of any crash or overall weirdness. Thanks!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to play:</h2>

      <li>Each game has 3 rounds;</li>
      <li>Guess correctly all three to win;</li>
      <li>One wrong answer and you're out;</li>
      <li>Rotate the Digital Crown to scrub the knob;</li>
      <li>When you start feeling some haptic feedback, that means you're close to the answer;</li>
      <li>One of the vibrations is going to be stronger than the others, that's the right answer;</li>
      <li>Tap the round button in the middle to select your answer;</li>
